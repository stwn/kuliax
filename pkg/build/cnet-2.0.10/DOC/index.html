<b><font size="+1">The <i>cnet</i> network simulator (v2.0.10)</font></b>
enables experimentation with various data-link layer, network layer,
routing and transport layer networking protocols in networks consisting of
any combination of point-to-point links and IEEE&nbsp;802.3 Ethernet segments.
<i>cnet</i> has been specifically developed for, and is used in,
undergraduate computer networking courses taken
by thousands of students worldwide since 1991.
At The University of Western Australia,
<i>cnet</i> is used primarily in
<a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/">Chris McDonald's</a>
undergraduate unit
<a href="http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/231.312/">
<i>Computer Networks (IT312)</i></a>.
<p>

<i>cnet</i> runs on a variety of UNIX and Linux platforms.
It <i>does not</i> run on either Windows or the Apple Macintosh.
The original and most up-to-date version of this documentation remains at
    <a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/cnet/">www.csse.uwa.edu.au/cnet/</a>.

<p>
Please appreciate that there are thousands of students worldwide
using <i>cnet</i>.
I am unable to respond to individual questions about <i>cnet</i>,
unless they are from students enrolled in a course that I'm presenting.
In particular, I will not answer homework or assignment questions.
Please ask <i>your</i> professor or instructor.

<i>If you can demonstrate that you are a member of academic staff somewhere
(business card, FAX on University letterhead, or official Web page),
I'll email some more detailed examples to you -
ones that may typically be set for student projects.</i>
<p>

If you decide to use <i>cnet</i> in the teaching of an undergraduate course,
or need some more info on how to, <i>please</i> let me know.
I'd like to keep a record of sites using <i>cnet</i> and the
types of examples and projects being attempted.
I'll also be able to keep you informed of updates.
