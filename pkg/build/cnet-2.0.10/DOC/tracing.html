<h3>Tracing <i>cnet</i>'s execution</h3>

The development and debugging of network protocols is a difficult task.
Without the support of a development environment,
the development of even a two-node protocol requires access to both nodes
and, possibly, the physical communication medium.
This is, of course, one of the proimary reasons that we use network
simulators, such as <i>cnet</i>.
We have the ability to ``peek'' inside each network node,
and even the communication links,
to see what is happening and to, hopefully, expose errors in our protocols.

<p>
Although <i>cnet</i> permits protocols to be written in ANSI-C and
executed natively in a single operating system process,
it does not provide traditional debugging support.
Moreover (unfortunately) because of the way <i>cnet</i> manipulates the
single process's data segments to schedule nodes,
standard debuggers can't ``keep up'' with what is happening.

<p>
<i>cnet</i> aids the development and debugging of network protocols with a
minimum of intrusion.
<i>cnet</i> enables the delivery and execution of events and <i>cnet</i>'s
own functions to be <i>traced</i>.
Each event's commencement and termination, and each function's invocation,
parameters, and return value annotated.
The picture below shows a <i>cnet</i> simulation which was commenced with
the <a href="options.html#option-t">-t</a> option to enable tracing.

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/tracing1.gif">
<p>

The displayed first line of the trace, above, indicates that the
handler for the <tt>EV_APPLICATIONREADY</tt> event
for the node Melbourne is being invoked at time <tt>728764ms</tt>.
Five lines later, execution leaves the same handler.
While executing the handler,
four of <i>cnet</i>'s standard functions were invoked.

<p>
The first of these (line 2) was
<a href="application.html#read_application"><tt>CNET_read_application</tt></a>.
On invocation the first two parameters are addresses
(such as requested with C's &amp; operator) to receive the destination
address and actual contents of the next message.
These addresses are printed as
hexadecimal values because no interpretation can be placed on their
initial contents, nor the memory to which these addresses refer.
In reality, the third parameter is also passed by address,
but we know that it represents the maximum possible length of the second
parameter (to receive the new message), so we are able to report that the
maximum length ``provided'' on entry to the function was <tt>8192</tt>.

<p>
The return value of <tt>CNET_read_application</tt> was <tt>0</tt>,
indicating success,
and the side-effects of the function,
modifying the destination address and length of the new message are also
reported with the new values of <tt>0</tt> and <tt>897</tt> respectively.
If an error had been detected,
the trace would indicate a return value of <tt>-1</tt> together with the
new value of the <tt>CnetError</tt> type in cnet_errno</tt>.

<p>
Note that due to <i>cnet</i>'s
<a href="eventdriven.html">event driven</a> programming style,
that events do not interrupt or preempt one another.
The trace stream will always show what is being executed with only one
level of indentation.

<p>
With reference to the <i>stopandwait</i> protocol,
we can see that the next event for Melbourne, at <tt>733274ms</tt>,
was a timeout for the Physical Layer transmission at <tt>728764ms</tt>.
We can see that the timer that has expired (<tt>t=168</tt>) was the one
that was started earlier,
and that the frame of length <tt>913</tt> bytes,
carrying the message of <tt>897</tt> bytes (ahhh, a 16 byte header),
is retransmitted as a result of the timeout.

<p>
The tracing of function parameters using only their hexadecimal addresses
is error-prone and confusing.
Moreover, different local variables in different event
handlers will have the same hexadecimal addresses (as they'll be on the
function's runtime stack), leading to more confusion.

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/tracing2.gif">
<p>

The picture above shows the same <i>stopandwait</i> protocol as above,
but a few additional C statements have been added to the protocol's code,
such as:
<br>
<pre><tt>      CNET_trace_name(&amp;destaddr, "dest");
      CNET_trace_name(lastmsg,   "newmessage");
</tt></pre>

<p>
These enable a variable's name (as a string) be be associated with the
variable's address. If an address has a known associated name/string,
this is printed to the trace stream instead of the hexadecimal address.
Calls to <tt>CNET_trace_name</tt> should be placed near the entry of each
event handler, and obviously before an address is to be traced.
The <tt>CNET_trace_name</tt> function is not, itself, traced.

<p>
By default, a copy of <i>cnet</i>'s <i>trace stream</i> appears under the
main window when <i>cnet</i> is invoked with
the <a href="options.html#option-t">-t</a> option.
Alternatively, tracing may be toggled using the windowing interface,
by selecting a checkbox to change the default or specific node's attributes.
When executing without the Tcl/Tk interface,
the trace stream appears via <i>cnet</i>'s <i>standard error</i> stream.
The complete trace stream may also be mirrored to a named file by setting the
<a href="attributes.html#gattrs">tracefile</a> global attribute. 

<p>
From within the C code of a protocol it is possible to trace only certain
events, possibly for only certain nodes of interest.
For example, a call such as
<tt>CNET_set_trace(TE_APPLICATIONREADY)</tt> will trace just
the <tt>EV_APPLICATIONREADY</tt> event for the invoking node.

The parameter to <tt>CNET_set_trace</tt> is really a bitmap of events of
interest, and so we may add or remove particular events
using C's bitwise operators:

    <b>int</b>   oldmask, newmask;

    oldmask  =  CNET_get_trace();
    newmask  =  oldmask | TE_PHYSICALREADY | TE_TIMER2;

    CNET_set_trace(newmask);
    ......
    ......
    CNET_set_trace(oldmask);
}
</tt></pre></tr></td></table></td></tr></table>

<p>
All required <tt>TE_*</tt> constants are defined in <i>cnet</i>'s header
file, along with the useful <tt>TE_ALLEVENTS</tt> and <tt>TE_NOEVENTS</tt>.
During the execution of an event handler that is being traced,
an arbitrary string may also be displayed with <tt>CNET_trace</tt> function,
which accepts a standard C <i>printf</i> format specification.

<h3>Tracing functions</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="trace"><tt>
<b>int</b>
CNET_trace(<b>const char</b> *format, ...)
</tt>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If tracing is requested (globally, or for certain nodes) this
<tt>printf()</tt>-like function will produce its output on the
<i>cnet</i>'s <tt>trace</tt> stream.
<p>
Possible errors: <tt>ER_BADARG.</tt>
<p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="trace_name"><tt>
<b>int</b>
CNET_trace_name(<b>void</b> *addr, <b>const char</b> *name)
</tt>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If tracing is requested (globally, or for certain nodes) function parameters
known to be addresses are annotated as (cryptic) hexademical values.
By recording a name (string) with an address,
the annotation is more meaningful.
<p>
Possible errors: <tt>ER_BADARG.</tt>
<p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="set_trace"><tt>
<b>int</b>
CNET_set_trace(<b>int</b> eventmask)
</tt>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Tracing is normally an ``all-or-nothing'' situation -
if requested, all events are annotated.
However, tracing may be requested programatically by providing an eventmask,
such as <tt>TE_APPLICATIONREADY|TE_PHYSICALREADY</tt>,
which will annotate just the requested events.
The ``all-or-nothing'' default represents
<tt>CNET_set_trace(TE_ALLEVENTS)</tt> or
<tt>CNET_set_trace(TE_NOEVENTS)</tt>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="get_trace"><tt>
<b>int</b>
CNET_get_trace(<b>void</b>)
</tt>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Returns an integer representing the eventmask of all events currently
being traced.
</dd>
