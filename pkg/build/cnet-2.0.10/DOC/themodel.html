<h3>The <i>cnet</i> simulation model</h3>

<i>cnet</i> supports a model of networking in which <i>nodes</i>
are connected by either <i>point-to-point</i> links
or <i>Ethernet</i> segments.
Nodes may be either <i>hosts</i> or <i>routers</i>;
introductory protocols will only use hosts and <i>point-to-point</i> links.
Hosts are like workstations,
with each having an Application Layer which generates messages for delivery
to the Application Layers on other hosts.
Hosts never generate messages for themself,
and routers never generate messages at all.
<p>
The <i>cnet</i> simulation model appears in the following diagram:
<p>

<IMG SRC="images/layers.gif">
</center>

<p>
Each node, from 2 to hundreds, is connected to other nodes by one or more
physical point-to-point links or IEEE&nbsp;802.3 Ethernet segments.
Links are numbered within each node
from <tt>0</tt> to the number of physical links that the node has.
Link number <tt>0</tt> is always the node's <tt>LOOPBACK</tt> link,
which simply delivers anything transmitted to it straight back to the same host.
The first ``real'' link is number <tt>1</tt> and every node will have
a link number <tt>1</tt>.
Each node's link attributes may be accessed, at runtime,
via elements of the C structure variables
<tt>linkinfo[1]</tt>,
<tt>linkinfo[2]</tt>, and so on.
<p>

<i>cnet</i> itself provides each node with an
<a href="application.html">Application Layer</a>
and a
<a href="physical.html">Physical Layer</a>.
In addition, a <i>hidden</i> Error Layer resides above the Physical Layer,
and causes transmitted data frames to become corrupted or lost according
to specified probabilities.
Note that the standard OSI/ISO model does not provide an Error Layer!

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly,
the nodes initially have very little knowledge of the network.
Nodes do not know how many other nodes there are,
what the other nodes are called,
nor the attributes of any nodes or links other than their own.
All inter-node communication necessary to learn this information
must traverse the Physical Layer.
<p>

<h3><a name="layers">Protocol layers</h3>

<p>
<i>cnet</i> protocols are written from the point of view of each node,
that is, we imagine that we are writing our protocols <i>inside</i> each node.
We have the ability to write all of the <i>interior protocols</i>
(or <i>student protocols</i>) between
the Application and Physical Layers (and even to rewrite these two layers
if we need).
The protocols may be as simple or as complex as desired,
and should follow a layered approach to isolate distinct responsibilities.
For example:

<ul>
<li> a network of only 2 nodes will only need a single layer
between the Application and Physical Layers (usually termed the Data-Link
Layer).  This protocol will simply have the responsibility of reliably
moving frames across the single bidirectional link between the two nodes.

<li> a network consisting of more than two nodes,
will (ideally) require an additional layer between the Application and
Data-Link Layers (usually termed the Network Layer) to manage packet
routing, possibly congestion- and flow-control, and message
fragmentation (and possibly some other responsibilities).

<li> a network in which the nodes may crash or the links may be severed
will (ideally) require an additional layer between the Network and
Application Layers (usually termed the Session Layer) to ensure that old
packets that have been ``floating'' around the network between crashes
are not considered as part of the <i>current</i> communication sequence, and

<li> a network in which we are conscious of limited bandwidth and security
may require an additional layer between the Session and
Application Layers (usually termed the Presentation Layer) to provide
compression and/or encryption of our data before it is transmitted.
</ul>
<p>

Of course,
these ideas and the responsibilities of each layer are not
peculiar to <i>cnet</i> protocols and are
very well motivated and described in many undergraduate textbooks on
data communications and computer networking.
However, <i>cnet</i> supports these ideas by <i>not getting in the way</i>,
by <i>not</i> imposing particular methodologies or data structures on your
protocols.

<p>
Protocols are written using an
<a href="eventdriven.html"> event-driven programming style</a>
as if we were writing the protocols as part of an operating system's kernel.
As well as handling network-related events,
a traditional operating system must handle other events for its file-system,
devices, and to let user-level processes execute.
For this reason, our protocols must execute as quickly as possible,
and then relinquish control to <i>cnet</i> (as if an operating system)
to permit other activities.
<i>cnet</i> is unaware of your using one or ten interior layers -
<i>cnet</i> only provides the highest and lowest layers,
and an <a href="functions.html">application programming interface (API)</a>
to interact with these layers.
<p>

<h3>The lifetime of a message</h3>

It is instructive to consider the <i>lifetime of a message</i> in <i>cnet</i>.
A message is first generated in the Application Layer of, say, <tt>node0</tt>
for delivery to the Application Layer of <tt>node1</tt>.
The Application Layer informs our interior protocol layer(s), via an event,
that a message requires delivery.
Our interior protocols do not know, nor care, about the contents of this
message, and simply treat it as a block of bytes.
Because the nodes are simulating distinct computers,
we must use the provided Physical Layer,
accessible via each node's link number 1, to deliver the message.
From the point of view of the <i>message</i>, this is what happens,
assuming that all goes well:

<ol>
<li> node0's Application Layer generates and announces the message,
<li> node0's interior protocol calls <tt>CNET_read_application</tt> to read
	(and thereafter own) the message and its intended destination (node1),
<li> node0's interior protocol does whatever it wants with the message,
<li> node0 calls <tt>CNET_write_physical</tt> to transmit a block of bytes
	(presumably including the message) via its link 1,
<p>
<li> after a short transmission delay, the bytes arrive at node1's
	Physical Layer via its link 1,
<li> node1's Physical Layer announces, via an event, the arrival,
<li> node1's interior protocol calls <tt>CNET_read_physical</tt> to read
	the bytes,
<li> node1's interior protocol does whatever it wants with the message,
<li> node1's interior protocol finally calls
	<tt>CNET_write_application</tt> to deliver the message to its
	Application Layer.
</ol>

<p>
As stated, the above sequence assumes that nothing goes wrong - and if
nothing went wrong, writing network protocols would be no fun!
We must obviously call the
<a href="functions.html"><i>cnet</i> functions</a> correctly,
but more importantly our interior protocols must detect and manage errors
in the network itself because
<i>cnet</i>'s Error Layer randomly corrupts and loses frames.
If we wish to only develop higher-layer protocols,
we can bypass <i>cnet</i>'s Error Layer entirely by calling
<tt>CNET_write_physical_reliable</tt>,
or get a frame to the correct destination node in a single action
by calling <tt>CNET_write_direct</tt>.
