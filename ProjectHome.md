A relatively complete GNU/Linux Live distribution developed and desktop optimized, for learning, research, and development use, primarily in higher education.

Kuliax is based on [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) stable and [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/), with [backports.org](http://backports.org) packages, our [custom](http://kuliax.net/pkgs) and [backport](http://kuliax.net/devel/pkg/backport) packages maintained for the distribution target.

Kuliax custom packages include artwork, electronic books, programs that needed by Kuliax but are not in Debian repo yet, optimized Linux kernel for desktop, and distro specific packages.

**License:** all sources created by Kuliax are GPL version 3, except modification from other projects that are not compatible with it. Check each files or packages for details.
